RE: improving the quality of the documentation tab

Possible steps (not necessarily in order):
- identify all of the blocks that we will use in the wizard
- generate a list of the terms and explanations we want to include in the documentation tab
- simplify existing documentation tab information to exclude redundant information and streamline the content
- write our own documentation information for the blocks (which would probably involve getting help from more experienced users)
- find external resources to provide users with inside the documentation tab
- expand the usefulness
